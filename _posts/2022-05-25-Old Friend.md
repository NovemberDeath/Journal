I see this girl, this girl I know from school. She is an old friend of mine. I liked her when we were in school. She has become an ‘Only Fans’ model for a living. Her friends are envious of her because she makes much more than what her friends make even though they have “respectable” jobs. They have stopped speaking to her because of envy.

I saw her one day and I wave at her and she instantly recognizes me. We eat together and talk about the old times. I say that I would like to see her again. We exchange numbers and I walk her home.

I call her again next day and ask her to meet again. She tells me to take her someplace private. Hearing this, I am a little startled but I am thrilled as well. I call in sick to work and get a place. She tells me she’ll be there. I am nervous but excited. I am stalking her on Instagram while I wait for her call.

She calls me, we meet up, we go to the place I got and spend the night. It is one of the best nights I have had for a while and it’s been a while since I have been at peace. We go out for lunch the next day and I have kinda forgotten till now how much my life sucks and my mind actually feels free today. We talk a lot and I know this is the last time I am going to see her. I can see it in her eyes, she just wanted me only for the night. She isn’t going to see me again. But I am okay with that. I am really okay right now. My head isn’t racing like usual and I remember now what silence actually feels like. I am okay with not seeing her again. She made me feel sane again and I am thankful to her.

We finish up our lunch. I say goodbye.

I hate this guy. This guy in my college. I don't know him, but I see him everyday at class and I don't like his face. Something about his face, his laugh makes me furious. I wish I could just punch his fat face once or twice or maybe multiple times. But I know that this is just my mind acting weird, how can I hate a guy whom I don't even know.

Its just a normal day, I am hanging with my friends from class and my cousin. My cousin has a shit ton of parent's money so he doesn't really attend classes and just comes to college to hang out with us. We are talking outside the college boundary and this cars comes along and grazes one of my friends, I instantly bang the door of the car while it passes us by.

My friend asks me to let it go, and I am fine with that but the guy driving comes out and throws a tantrum. Coincidentally its the same guy that I hate. As soon as I recognize him everything slows down. All the background noises are muffled and I can only see his mouth moving try to scream at me for banging his car. I am just zoned out right now as I look at him and notice there is now a hole in his head. Everything returns to normal speed and he falls down with a pool of blood below his head. All of my friends are not moving. They are unable to comprehend what has happened. But I see kids running everywhere around us screaming.

My cousin has a gun in his hand, he shot him. He grabs me, gets on his bike and right now shouting at me to get on it. I get on we get going. I am not able to think right now, maybe all of this has me shook. We stop around 10 minutes from our college. My cousin gets off, writes a phone number down on a paper and hands it over to me. He mumbles a lot of words but I am not really listening and then he rides away. And I am just standing there at the side of a road. The only thought in my mind how I wish I was the one that had pulled the trigger.
